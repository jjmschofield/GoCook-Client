# GoCook Clients

This project contains the clients for [GoCook](https://github.com/jjmschofield/GoCook)!

Right now there is only a web client in React, in the future there might also be a mobile client in React Native.  

## Getting Started
### Web Client
You'll find this over in `./gocook-web`. This project has its own [README.md](gocook-web/README.md) which contains all the information.

## Deployments
### Web Client
The web client is presently deploying to Heroku, you can find it at [https://go-cook-web.herokuapp.com/](https://go-cook-web.herokuapp.com/)

## On Repository Structure

We have separated the api and client repositories to allow for completely separate development cycles.
 
We have kept clients together so that we can get code re-use which is free of package management.

# Now Go Cook!
